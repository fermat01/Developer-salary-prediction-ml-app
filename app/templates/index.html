      <p>Stack Overflow is a question and answer website for professional and enthusiast programmers. It is the flagship
        site of the Stack Exchange Network.It was created in 2008 by Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky.
        It features questions and answers on a wide range of topics in computer programming. It was created to be a more
        open alternative to earlier question and answer websites such as Experts-Exchange. Stack Overflow was sold to
        Prosus, a Netherlands-based consumer internet conglomerate, on 2 June 2021 for $1.8 billion.
        <br>
        The website serves as a platform for users to ask and answer questions, and, through membership and active
        participation, to vote questions and answers up or down similar to Reddit and edit questions and answers in a
        fashion similar to a wiki. Users of Stack Overflow can earn reputation points and "badges"; for example, a
        person is awarded 10 reputation points for receiving an "up" vote on a question or an answer to a question, and
        can receive badges for their valued contributions, which represents a gamification of the traditional Q&A
        website.
        Users unlock new privileges with an increase in reputation like the ability to vote, comment, and even edit
        other people's posts.
